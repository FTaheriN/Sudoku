# Sudoku
There are two phases to this program. In the first phase, sudokuSloverChecker, a [sudoku puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) can be built and a table can be checked to see if it is a sudoku puzzle.
The second phase, sudokuCheckerThread, only checks the input table with row, column and smaller square validity. These chekcing parts are done using threads which makes the process hell lot faster.
